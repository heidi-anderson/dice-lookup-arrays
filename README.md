# dice-lookup-arrays
This is the sixth assignment in CSC 115. When given an array of die rolls it has functions that will tell you the fewest rolled num, the most rolled, and the sum of the numbers rolled. 
This program was written at the beginning of my journey into computer science in the Spring of 2022.
